    This is a 3D file format that currently doesn't support coloring. This format could be used in the same ways an stl file is used, for example it would be a good fit for 3D modeling or 3D printing. The advantage of this format is that it is substantially smaller than a stl file. There are currently two versions of the writer, the first one is the recommended on and is the C# version. This is recommended because it is faster and is more finalized. The second version is the python version which I used for prototyping and it is really slow.
	You can run the C# version by opening “bin\Debug\net6.0\cstl_writer.exe”. You put the input stl files into the “InputFiles” folder and the program spits them out into the “OutputFiles” folder.
